# League of Legends Data Mining Project

# Overview
The  final requirement to fulfill my desired certification level with EcZachly's Data Engineering Bootcamp is an engineered dataset from raw sources into a polished dataset using modern technologies. Despite that being the case of how this project started, the intent is to use this as a chance to perform data science on League of Legends. The focus of this project is to investigate the items in League of Legends, their performance, and metrics on what makes a good item and some assistance to discover interesting builds, both crowdsourced as it is today and certain unseen builds that might be worth a try.

 Indeed, [Kaggle does possess a wealth of datasets  from Riot's Match API or League of Legends (LoL) Esports matches](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=league+of+legends+in%3Adatasets), but none have an ideal collation of matches with item statistics. Item builds have been a controversial debate since League's inception, but has picked up steam in recent years. Moreover, League has done another significant overhaul of the item system. Every week there are certain builds and "techs" discovered, from [purchasing multiple support items on the same team](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/195i0v1/new_double_support_item_math/?rdt=44431) to trying out [auto attack manipulation on different champions with Titanic Hydra on ranged champions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1abowwy/new_tech_on_cait_taking_over_the_top_of_the/) 
 
 Even moreso, since certain Esports Leagues are playing on the live patch as opposed to traditionally being a week+ behind, it is even more critical to discover new strategies faster. While there are sites such as Blitz.gg that can recommend item builds, those are usually dependent on what occurred in the patch and recommends the most popular buiilds. In addition, they do not offer the data in a disaggregated manner to investigate. With the item changes in constant flux, a consistently updated item dataset would serve the community well.

## Desired Insights
As mentioned prior, 

 ## Datasets

 The goal is to produce a final dataset that fulfils these characteristics:
 - Is highly accurate.
 - Has the dimensions updated soon after a new patch or hotfix is pushed.
 - Requires a minimal amount of joins to ingest and visualize.
 - Provides a single platform to easily pull data from.

 To fulfil the required final dataset, we need data that can provide details to these field
